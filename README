  RGBDS README
----------------

RGBDS (Rednex Game Boy Development System) is a free assembler/linker package
for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. It consists of:

  - rgbasm  (assembler)
  - rgblink (linker)
  - rgbfix  (checksum/header fixer)
  - rgbgfx  (PNG‐to‐Game Boy graphics converter)

rgbds-linux is a fork of the original RGBDS which aims to make the programs
more like other UNIX tools.



  Installing RGBDS
=========================

-------------------------
  macOS
-------------------------

You can use Homebrew (http://brew.sh/):

  brew install rgbds

or

  brew install rgbds --build-from-source

or

  brew install rgbds --HEAD

Additionally, UNIX-like compilation is available (see below)

-------------------------
  UNIX
-------------------------

Check Makefile for user-defined variables:

PREFIX
  Location where RGBDS will be installed.
  Defaults to /usr/local.

BINPREFIX
  Location where the RGBDS programs will be installed.
  Defaults to ${PREFIX}/bin.

MANPREFIX
  Location where the RGBDS man pages will be installed.
  Defaults to ${PREFIX}/man.

Q
  Quiet. To make the build more verbose, clear this variable.
  Defaults to @.

Additionally, there are specific variables for dependency resolution.

*_CFLAGS
*_LDFLAGS
*_LIBS
  Where * is ASM, LINK, FIX or GFX e.g. ASM_CFLAGS

Dependencies are refered to in further in this document.

To build the programs on a UNIX or UNIX-like system, just run in your terminal

  make [<FLAG>=<FVALUE>...]

e.g. this is a common way of compiling RGBDS, resolving deps via pkg-config

  make GFX_CFLAGS='`pkg-config libpng --cflags`' GFX_LIBS='`pkg-config libpng --libs`'

To install the compiled programs and manual pages, run (with appropriate
privileges)

  make install

After installation, you can read the manuals with the man(1) command. E.g.,

  man 1 rgbasm
